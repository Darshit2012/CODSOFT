# Sales Prediction

## Overview  
The dataset contains advertising data with sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product, along with advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media.  
The task was to analyze this data and suggest a marketing plan for future sales by building robust regression models and selecting the best-performing one.

The project was implemented using **Python** with **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn** for analysis and model development.

## Project Details  
- **Objective**: Predict sales based on the given advertising expenditures.  
- **Models Used**:  
  - KNN Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regression  
  - ElasticNet Regression  
  - Lasso Regression  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - XGBoost Regression  
  - Random Forest Regression  
  - Gradient Boosting Regression  

- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting Regression  
- **Accuracy Achieved**: 96%  
- **MSE Achieved**: 1.245

## Key Features  
- Analyzed the Sales Prediction dataset through data visualization, preprocessing, and machine learning model selection.  
- Identified dataset characteristics such as relationships and noise that affect model performance.  
- Observed **outliers** in the *Newspaper* category, while TV and Radio had none.  
- **Gradient Boosting Regression** outperformed all other models with the highest accuracy (96%) and lowest MSE (1.245).  
- **Random Forest Regression** came second with 95% accuracy (MSE = 1.496), followed by **XGBoost Regression** with 93.9% accuracy (MSE = 1.880).  
- The best-performing Gradient Boosting model‚Äôs sales predictions were saved for deployment.
