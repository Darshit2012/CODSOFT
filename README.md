# CODSOFT Data Science Internship
Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship Portfolio! This repository features a collection of projects Iâ€™ve worked on during my internship at CODSOFT. Each project reflects my hands-on experience with data analysis, machine learning, and critical thinking to solve real-world problems.


## INTRODUCTION:
Iâ€™m excited to present my journey through the CODSOFT Data Science Internship, where I had the chance to complete five intriguing tasks, each targeting different areas of data science. This internship offered a deep dive into practical applications of concepts and tools, and Iâ€™m proud to share the outcomes of these projects. Below is an overview of the tasks assigned during the internship.
## DATA SCIENCE TASKS:
- TASK 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
  - Source: Kaggle â€“ Titanic Dataset
  - Objective: Develop a machine learning model that predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on variables like age, gender, class, fare, and cabin data. This is a classic starter project in the world of data science that introduces key concepts in data preprocessing and binary classification.
