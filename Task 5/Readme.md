# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Overview
Developed a Fraudulent Transactions Detection System to prevent customers from being charged for unauthorized purchases using machine learning on credit card transaction data.

- The dataset is highly imbalanced, so undersampling technique was applied to balance the data.
- Implemented the project using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Seaborn** for analysis and model development.
- Utilized **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**, achieving **>94% accuracy** on test data for both models.
- **Random Forest Classifier** outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of **F1-score**.

## 🎯 Project Details
- **Objective**: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning techniques.  
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier (Scikit-learn).  
- **Accuracy Achieved**: >94% for both models.  
- **F1-score**:  
  - Logistic Regression → **94%**  
  - Random Forest Classifier → **95%**

## ⚡ Key Features
- Used **undersampling** to handle the imbalanced dataset.  
- Both models show balanced performance in identifying fraud and non-fraud transactions.  
- Precision for both models is high, with Random Forest achieving higher precision than Logistic Regression.  
- Evaluated performance using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Plotted **Confusion Matrix**, **ROC-AUC curve**, and **Precision-Recall curve** for better interpretability.
