# üå∏ IRIS Flower Classification

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on **classifying Iris flower species** using machine learning models.  
It includes:
- Importing necessary libraries  
- Data inspection & visualization  
- Model building  
- Generating predictions  
- Evaluating model performance  

The primary goal of this **multiclass classification project** is to build a robust ML model that can predict the species type of an Iris flower based on its **morphological features**.  

This work enhances the understanding of morphological variations in Iris species and benefits **botanists, researchers, and horticulturists** by improving the ability to categorize and interpret species diversity.

## üéØ Project Details
- **Objective**: Classify Iris flower species using ML models.  
- **Models Used**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  

- **Best Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- **Performance (KNN)**:  
  - Accuracy: **97%**  
  - Precision: **97.8%**  
  - Recall: **97.3%**  
  - F1-Score: **97.4%**

## üßπ Key Insights
- Dataset is **balanced** ‚Üí equal records for all three species.  
- **Features**: Four numerical (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one categorical (species).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** included:  
  - Boxplots, Pairplots, Histograms, Density plots  
  - Swarm plots, Violin plots, Correlation heatmap  
  - Pie chart for species distribution  

- **Findings**:  
  - *Setosa* ‚Üí most distinguishable due to small feature size.  
  - *Versicolor & Virginica* ‚Üí often overlap; Versicolor has medium-sized features, Virginica has larger features.  
  - **Petal length & petal width** are the most discriminative features for classification.  

- **ML Models**: Successfully trained multiple classifiers, with **KNN outperforming others** on unseen data.

## üèÜ Best Model
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚Üí Best performing model with **97% accuracy** and strong precision/recall balance.  
- **Logistic Regression** also achieved perfect scores, but KNN showed consistent robustness across multiple test splits.

## üöÄ Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV) for further optimization.  
- Deploy the model using **Flask/Streamlit** for interactive predictions.  
- Extend dataset with **real-world flower measurements** for improved generalization.
